This is the Docker image for AMS 595: Fundamental of Computing at Stony Brook
University. This image is based on Ubuntu 16.04. It has Octave, Python 3,
Jupyter Notebook, g++-5.4, Atom, LAPACK, ddd, valgrind, and mpich preinstalled.
You can also use MATLAB if you started the script using the "-m" option.
Please save your code and data into ~/shared or ~/project directories. The
former maps to the current work directory on your computer. The latter maps
to the Docker data volume named ams595_project.

Enjoy programming!
