This is the Docker image for AMS 595: Fundamental of Computing at Stony Brook
University. This image is based on Ubuntu 16.04. It has Octave 4.2.1, SciPy and
Spyder for Python 3, Jupyter Notebook for Python 3 and Octave, g++-5.4, Atom,
LAPACK, ddd, and valgrind preinstalled. You can also use MATLAB if you started
the Docker container using ams595_desktop.py with the "-m" option.

Please save your code and data into ~/shared or ~/project directories. The
former maps to the current work directory on your computer. The latter maps
to the Docker data volume named ams595_project.

Happy programming!
