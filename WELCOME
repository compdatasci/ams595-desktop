This is the Docker image for AMS 595: Fundamental of Computing at Stony Brook
University. This image is based on Ubuntu 16.04. It has Octave, SciPy, Spyder,
Jupyter Notebook, g++-5.4, Atom, LAPACK, ddd, valgrind, and mpich preinstalled.
You can also use MATLAB if you started the ams595_desktop.py script with the
"-m" option. Please save your code and data into ~/shared or ~/project
directories. The former maps to the current work directory on your computer.
The latter maps to the Docker data volume named ams595_project.

Enjoy programming!
