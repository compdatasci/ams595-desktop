Welcome to the Docker image for AMS 595: Fundamentals of Computing!

This image is based on Ubuntu 18.04, with Octave 4.2.2, SciPy and Spyder for
Python 3.6, Jupyter Notebook for Python and Octave, g++-7.3, LAPACK, ddd,
valgrind, and various editors preinstalled.

Please save your code and data into the ~/shared or ~/project directories.
The former maps to the current work directory on your computer. The latter
maps to the Docker data volume named ams595_project on your host.

To use git with ssh authentication, make sure the ssh key on your host computer
is in bitbucket and github, and then run "ssh-add" in this terminal to add your
ssh key to the ssh-agent.
